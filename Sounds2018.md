# Sounds of 2018

ANOTHER ONE!  So this year I've pulled together the stuff I've been listening to and most of it wasn't released this year.  Big highlights would be the wedding playlist (absolute blast to put together), Four Tet's radio sessions, and developing my impression of Kurt Vile (I think it's getting pretty good).
